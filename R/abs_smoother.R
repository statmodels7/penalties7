#' @title S7 Class for Smoothers of the Absolute Value
#'
#' @description
#' A smooth replacement \eqn{s(u)} for \eqn{\lvert u \rvert}, carrying its
#' derivatives in \eqn{u} up to order five as functions. Every non-smooth
#' primitive the toolkit uses is generated from the absolute value:
#'
#' \deqn{\operatorname{sign}(u) = \frac{d\lvert u\rvert}{du}, \qquad
#'   \mathbb{1}(u \geq 0) = \frac{1 + \operatorname{sign}(u)}{2}, \qquad
#'   (u)_{+} = \frac{u + \lvert u\rvert}{2},}
#'
#' so one contract serves them all. The smooth sign is \eqn{s'}, the smooth
#' step \eqn{(1 + s'(u))/2} and the smooth hinge \eqn{(u + s(u))/2} follow by
#' composition, and a consumer that replaces \eqn{\lvert u\rvert} by \eqn{s(u)}
#' has replaced every one of them consistently.
#'
#' @details
#' # What a smoother buys
#'
#' A break-point term smoothed this way becomes an ordinary nonlinear term
#' whose design block is the true Jacobian, so a random or penalized
#' development of its break-points becomes fittable. A kinked penalty
#' smoothed this way becomes a proper separable one, at the price of the exact
#' zeros the kink produced.
#'
#' # The derivatives are functions
#'
#' They are functions and not expressions. A piecewise smoother, the quintic
#' here, has branches that [stats::deriv()] does not read, and with the
#' derivatives written out in the constructor those branches are ordinary code.
#' Each takes `(u, width)` and vectorizes in both, so a per-group width is one
#' value per observation.
#'
#' # The width
#'
#' `width` is the transition scale: `h` for a smoother whose parameter is a
#' length, the bent-cable reading of a transition of width \eqn{h}, and `c` for
#' the hyperbolic, whose parameter is a squared length. `NULL`, the default of
#' all three constructors, asks the consumer to resolve it from the data at
#' build through [smoother_width()]; a break-point term hands it the median
#' spacing of its covariate. `per_group` asks for one width per group where a
#' grouping is available, the validity window of a Laplace approximation being
#' per-subject.
#'
#' # The scale correction
#'
#' `tau_correction` is a property of the mollifier and of no model. The probit
#' smoother satisfies an exact convolution identity, smoothing with width
#' \eqn{h} being the same as convolving the break-point with \eqn{N(0, h^2)},
#' so an apparent scale \eqn{\tau} of a random break-point composes as
#' \eqn{\tau^2_{\mathrm{true}} = \tau^2 - h^2} and the smoother declares that
#' correction. Smoothers with no such identity declare `NULL`, and a consumer
#' then reports the apparent scale alone.
#'
#' @param smoother_name A single non-empty string naming the smoother, used by
#'   `print()` and by a consumer reporting which smoother a term carries.
#' @param width The transition width, a single positive number, or `NULL` to be
#'   resolved at build.
#' @param width_name What the width parameter is called, a single non-empty
#'   string: `"h"` for a length and `"c"` for a squared one. `"h"` by default.
#' @param per_group `TRUE` when the width is resolved per group, `FALSE` (the
#'   default) for one width throughout.
#' @param s A list of exactly six functions of `(u, width)`: \eqn{s} and its
#'   derivatives in \eqn{u} of orders one to five, in that order. Each must
#'   take at least two arguments; the validator checks the count and the arity.
#' @param width_from_spacing `NULL` (the identity) or a function carrying a
#'   spacing in covariate units onto the width parameter's own scale, which is
#'   the square for the hyperbolic.
#' @param tau_correction `NULL`, or a function `(tau, width)` returning the
#'   corrected scale of a random break-point.
#' @param exact_radius `NULL`, or a function of the width returning the radius
#'   beyond which \eqn{s(u) = \lvert u\rvert} exactly. Only the quintic has
#'   one.
#'
#' @return An S7 object of class `abs_smoother` carrying the eight properties
#'   above.

#' The Probit Smoother of the Absolute Value
#'
#' @description
#' \eqn{s(u) = \mathbb{E}\lvert u + hZ\rvert} for \eqn{Z} standard normal, the
#' one to reach for unless you have a reason not to. Its excess over
#' \eqn{\lvert u\rvert} has gaussian tails, so the smoothing bias is confined
#' to a window of width \eqn{h} around the kink, and it is the only one of the
#' three that declares a scale correction for a random break-point.
#'
#' @details
#' # The closed form
#'
#' \deqn{s(u) = u\,\bigl(2\Phi(u/h) - 1\bigr) + 2h\,\phi(u/h), \qquad
#'   s'(u) = 2\Phi(u/h) - 1, \qquad s''(u) = \frac{2}{h}\,\phi(u/h),}
#'
#' with the third to fifth derivatives following from
#' \eqn{\phi'(z) = -z\phi(z)}. At the kink \eqn{s(0) = 2h\phi(0) \approx
#' 0.798h}, which is the intrinsic scale [check_abs_smoother()] places its grid
#' by.
#'
#' # Why the tails matter
#'
#' The excess \eqn{s(u) - \lvert u\rvert} decays like \eqn{\phi(u/h)}, so it
#' is gone within a few widths. Measured at \eqn{h = 0.3}: `6.7e-05` at
#' \eqn{u = 1} and exactly `0` at \eqn{u = 3}, against `4.4e-02` and `1.5e-02`
#' for [smooth_hyperbolic()] at the same transition width. A model smoothed
#' this way is the sharp model to within rounding a short distance from the
#' break-point.
#'
#' # The convolution identity
#'
#' Smoothing the step with width \eqn{h} is exactly convolving the break-point
#' with \eqn{N(0, h^2)}, so a random break-point of true scale \eqn{\tau}
#' appears at \eqn{\sqrt{\tau^2 + h^2}}, and the smoother declares
#' \eqn{\tau_{\mathrm{true}} = \sqrt{\tau^2 - h^2}}, floored at zero. No other
#' smoother here has such an identity.
#'
#' @param h The transition width, a single positive number, or `NULL` (the
#'   default) to be resolved at build from the covariate's spacing through
#'   [smoother_width()].
#' @param per_group `TRUE` to resolve the width once per group, `FALSE` (the
#'   default) for one width throughout. The validity window of a Laplace
#'   approximation is per-subject, so a hierarchical break-point wants `TRUE`.
#'
#' @return An [abs_smoother()] named `"probit"`, with `width_name` `"h"`, no
#'   `width_from_spacing` (the spacing is the width), a `tau_correction`, and

#' The Hyperbolic Smoother of the Absolute Value
#'
#' @description
#' \eqn{s(u) = \sqrt{u^2 + c}}, the simplest smoother of the three and the one
#' with the worst tails. Its parameter \eqn{c} is a **squared** length, so the
#' transition width in covariate units is \eqn{\sqrt{c}}.
#'
#' @details
#' # The closed form
#'
#' \deqn{s(u) = \sqrt{u^2 + c}, \qquad s'(u) = \frac{u}{\sqrt{u^2 + c}},
#'   \qquad s''(u) = \frac{c}{(u^2 + c)^{3/2}},}
#'
#' every order a rational function of \eqn{u} over a half-integer power, so
#' nothing here needs a special function or a branch.
#'
#' # The cost of the tails
#'
#' The excess over \eqn{\lvert u\rvert} decays only as \eqn{c/(2\lvert
#' u\rvert)}, so the smoothing bias spreads well away from the kink. Measured
#' at a transition width of `0.3`, so \eqn{c = 0.09}: the excess is `4.4e-02`
#' at \eqn{u = 1} and `1.5e-02` at \eqn{u = 3}, against `6.7e-05` and exactly
#' `0` for [smooth_probit()] at the same width. A fit smoothed this way is
#' perturbed everywhere, not only near the break-point.
#'
#' No convolution identity relates \eqn{c} to the scale of a random
#' break-point, so `tau_correction` is `NULL` and a consumer reports the
#' apparent scale alone.
#'
#' @param c The squared transition width, a single positive number, or `NULL`
#'   (the default) to be resolved at build as the **square** of the covariate's
#'   spacing, through [smoother_width()].
#'
#' @return An [abs_smoother()] named `"hyperbolic"`, with `width_name` `"c"`, a

#' The Quintic Smoother of the Absolute Value
#'
#' @description
#' \eqn{\lvert u\rvert} replaced inside \eqn{[-h, h]} by the even polynomial
#' matching it to third order at the seam, and **exact** outside. It is the
#' only smoother here whose bias is zero beyond a finite radius, and the only
#' one that is not analytic.
#'
#' @details
#' # The closed form
#'
#' With \eqn{t = u/h},
#'
#' \deqn{s(u) = \frac{h}{16}\,\bigl(5 + 15t^2 - 5t^4 + t^6\bigr)
#'   \quad \text{for } \lvert t\rvert < 1, \qquad
#'   s(u) = \lvert u\rvert \quad \text{otherwise},}
#'
#' so \eqn{s''(u) = 15(1 - t^2)^2/(8h)} vanishes to second order at \eqn{\pm h}
#' and the function is \eqn{C^3}, with a jump in the fourth derivative at the
#' seam. At the kink \eqn{s(0) = 5h/16}.
#'
#' # Exact outside the transition
#'
#' The smoothing bias is exactly zero outside \eqn{[-h, h]}, which is the
#' cleanest fixed-width choice: measured at \eqn{h = 0.3} the excess over
#' \eqn{\lvert u\rvert} is `0` at \eqn{u = 1} and at \eqn{u = 3}, where
#' [smooth_probit()] leaves `6.7e-05` and [smooth_hyperbolic()] `4.4e-02`. The
#' smoother declares an `exact_radius`, so a consumer can say where its answer
#' is the sharp model's.
#'
#' The branches are why [abs_smoother()] carries the derivatives as functions:
#' [stats::deriv()] does not read a clamp, and written out in the constructor
#' the branches are ordinary code.
#'
#' There is no convolution identity here, so `tau_correction` is `NULL`.

#' the given spacing carried onto the width parameter's own scale. This is what
#' a consumer calls at build: a break-point term hands it the median spacing of
#' its covariate, the smallest transition the data can tell from a step.
#'
#' @details
#' A smoother constructed with an explicit width keeps it, and `spacing` is
#' then not even looked at. A smoother constructed with `NULL` takes the
#' spacing through its own `width_from_spacing`, which is the identity for
#' [smooth_probit()] and [smooth_quintic()], whose parameter is a length, and
#' the square for [smooth_hyperbolic()], whose parameter is a squared one.
#'
#' The result is nothing about whether the width is large enough for the
#' arithmetic; [smoother_width_floor()] answers that separately, and a consumer
#' takes the larger of the two.
#'
#' @param smoother An [abs_smoother()]. Anything else is rejected.
#' @param spacing A spacing in covariate units, one value or one per group.
#'   Every entry must be positive and none may be missing; a smoother that
#'   already carries a width never reaches the check.
#'
#' @return The width, on the smoother's own scale. The same length as `spacing`
#'   when resolved from it, and a single number when the smoother carries one.
#'
#' @examples
#' # A length-parametrized smoother takes the spacing as it stands.

#' The Smallest Width a Consumer May Use
#'
#' @description
#' Returns the floor of the width, derived from the expression that binds. A
#' consumer resolving a width from data takes the larger of this and
#' [smoother_width()]'s answer.
#'
#' @details
#' # Where the bound comes from
#'
#' The derivatives of a smoother scale as \eqn{s^{(k)} \sim h^{1-k}}, so the
#' Jacobian column of a smoothed break-point carries \eqn{s''(0)/2 \sim 1/h}
#' against covariate columns of order the range \eqn{D}. Holding the design's
#' condition number below \eqn{\epsilon^{-1/2}}, which leaves half the digits
#' of a double to a QR of the design, gives
#'
#' \deqn{h \geq \sqrt{\epsilon}\,D,}
#'
#' carried onto the width parameter's own scale for a smoother parametrized by
#' a squared length. At a covariate range of 10 that is `1.49e-07` for
#' [smooth_probit()] and its square, `2.22e-14`, for [smooth_hyperbolic()].
#'
#' The bound is derived, which is the toolkit's rule for a guard constant, and
#' it is the same argument the break-point schedule's own scaling floor rests
#' on.
#'
#' @param smoother An [abs_smoother()]. Anything else is rejected.
#' @param scale The scale of the covariate, its range, a single positive
#'   number. Anything else is rejected.

#' The width line reads `h resolved at build` where the smoother carries none,

#' Check a Smoother of the Absolute Value Numerically
#'
#' @description
#' Compares a smoother against the properties every smoother of
#' \eqn{\lvert u\rvert} must have, and each derivative order against one
#' numerical differentiation of the analytic order below it. Returns one row
#' per check with the worst error and a pass or fail. Write a smoother of your
#' own and this says whether its five derivatives are right.
#'
#' @details
#' # The rows
#'
#' Ten checks, and two more for a smoother declaring a scale correction:
#'
#' | row | what it asserts |
#' |---|---|
#' | `s is even` | \eqn{s(-u) = s(u)}, relative to the size of \eqn{s} |
#' | `s' is odd` | \eqn{s'(-u) = -s'(u)} |
#' | `\|s'\| bounded by one` | the smooth sign never leaves \eqn{[-1, 1]} |
#' | `s convex` | \eqn{s'' \ge 0} on the grid |
#' | `matches \|u\| in the tails` | the excess ten intrinsic widths out is at most a fifth of the excess at the kink |
#' | `order k vs numDeriv on order k-1` | five rows, \eqn{k} from 1 to 5 |
#' | `tau_correction bounded by tau` | the correction never increases a scale |
#' | `tau_correction is the identity at width zero` | it vanishes as the smoothing does |
#'
#' Order \eqn{k} goes against \pkg{numDeriv} applied **once** to the analytic
#' order \eqn{k-1}, so a wrong derivative is caught against an independent
#' route while the reference never degenerates into a difference of
#' differences. Over the three shipped smoothers at four widths each, every row
#' passes and the worst error is `1.3e-10`.
#'
#' The tail row is deliberately loose, at a fifth of the excess at the kink,
#' because [smooth_hyperbolic()]'s polynomial tails would fail a tight one and
#' are a legitimate choice: its excess is \eqn{c/(2\lvert u\rvert)}, a
#' twentieth of the kink's value ten widths out.
#'
#' # Where the grid goes
#'
#' The grid spans the transition and the tails, placed by the smoother's own
#' intrinsic scale \eqn{s(0)}, which is of order the transition width for any
#' smoother of the absolute value, so no reading of what the width parameter
#' means is needed. Every point sits off zero and off the seam: a piecewise
#' smoother has measure-zero points where a one-sided derivative is read, and a
#' difference straddling one compares nothing.
#'
#' # What it catches
#'
#' This is not decoration. Writing [smooth_quintic()], a factor-2 error in its
#' own \eqn{s'''} was caught here before anything shipped: the order-3 row read
#' a relative `0.5` and the order-4 row `1.0`, the wrong third derivative
#' becoming the reference for the fourth. The examples below reproduce it.
#'
#' @param smoother An [abs_smoother()]. Anything else is rejected.
#' @param width The width to check at, a single positive number, or `NULL` (the
#'   default) for the smoother's own. A smoother carrying none is checked at
#'   `0.5`, a scale chosen to exercise the formulas and saying nothing about
#'   any data.
#' @param tol The relative error above which a row is reported as `FAILED`. A
#'   single positive number, `1e-6` by default. The worst error the three
#'   shipped smoothers reach is `1.3e-10`, four orders under it, so the default
#'   separates a correct smoother from one whose derivative is wrong in its
#'   fourth digit.
#' @param verbose `TRUE`, the default, prints a header naming the smoother and
#'   the width, then the table without row names, and returns invisibly.
#'   `FALSE` returns the table.
#'
#' @return A data frame with one row per check and three columns: `check`
#'   (character), `max_error` (numeric) and `status` (character, `"OK"` or
#'   `"FAILED"`). Ten rows, or twelve when the smoother declares a
#'   `tau_correction`. Returned invisibly when `verbose` is `TRUE`.
#'
#' @section Errors:
#' \pkg{numDeriv} is in `Suggests` and every derivative row needs it, so the
#' function stops when it is not installed.
#'
#' @examples
