# penalties7 0.1.0

* First release: penalties as S7 objects, rho(D beta; theta), with the
  value, the exact derivatives in the coefficients and the
  hyperparameters, the mixed block, and the declared kink set. Three
  branches: `quadratic_penalty()` (rank, null basis and log
  pseudo-determinant fixed at construction, the pieces a marginal
  criterion consumes), `distrib_penalty()` (a univariate distributions7
  log-density applied coordinatewise, with `ridge_penalty()`,
  `lasso_penalty()` and `heavy_penalty()` as named instances), and
  `scad_penalty()`/`mcp_penalty()` (defined by their derivative, improper
  by construction). Normalizing constants are kept throughout, so a
  proper penalty is exactly the negative log-density of its prior.
  `check_penalty()` validates every closed form against a route sharing
  no code with it.
