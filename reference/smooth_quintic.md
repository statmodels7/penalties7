# The Quintic Smoother of the Absolute Value

\\\lvert u\rvert\\ replaced inside \\\[-h, h\]\\ by the even polynomial
matching it to third order at the seam, and **exact** outside. It is the
only smoother here whose bias is zero beyond a finite radius, and the
only one that is not analytic.

## Usage

``` r
smooth_quintic(h = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- h:

  The transition half-width, a single positive number, or `NULL` (the
  default) to be resolved at build from the covariate's spacing through
  [`smoother_width()`](https://statmodels7.github.io/penalties7/reference/smoother_width.md).

## Value

An
[`abs_smoother()`](https://statmodels7.github.io/penalties7/reference/abs_smoother.md)
named `"quintic"`, with `width_name` `"h"`, no `width_from_spacing`, no
`tau_correction`, and an `exact_radius` equal to the width.

## The closed form

With \\t = u/h\\,

\$\$s(u) = \frac{h}{16}\\\bigl(5 + 15t^2 - 5t^4 + t^6\bigr) \quad
\text{for } \lvert t\rvert \< 1, \qquad s(u) = \lvert u\rvert \quad
\text{otherwise},\$\$

so \\s''(u) = 15(1 - t^2)^2/(8h)\\ vanishes to second order at \\\pm h\\
and the function is \\C^3\\, with a jump in the fourth derivative at the
seam. At the kink \\s(0) = 5h/16\\.

## Exact outside the transition

The smoothing bias is exactly zero outside \\\[-h, h\]\\, which is the
cleanest fixed-width choice: measured at \\h = 0.3\\ the excess over
\\\lvert u\rvert\\ is `0` at \\u = 1\\ and at \\u = 3\\, where
[`smooth_probit()`](https://statmodels7.github.io/penalties7/reference/smooth_probit.md)
leaves `6.7e-05` and
[`smooth_hyperbolic()`](https://statmodels7.github.io/penalties7/reference/smooth_hyperbolic.md)
`4.4e-02`. The smoother declares an `exact_radius`, so a consumer can
say where its answer is the sharp model's.

The branches are why
[`abs_smoother()`](https://statmodels7.github.io/penalties7/reference/abs_smoother.md)
carries the derivatives as functions:
[`stats::deriv()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/deriv.html) does not read a
clamp, and written out in the constructor the branches are ordinary
code.

There is no convolution identity here, so `tau_correction` is `NULL`.

## Examples

``` r
sm <- smooth_quintic(h = 0.5)

# Outside the transition it is the absolute value, exactly.
smoother_deriv(sm, 1, order = 0)
#> [1] 1
smoother_deriv(sm, c(0.6, 1, 4), order = 0) - c(0.6, 1, 4)
#> [1] 0 0 0

# At the kink the value is 5h/16.
smoother_deriv(sm, 0, order = 0)
#> [1] 0.15625
5 * 0.5 / 16
#> [1] 0.15625

# The second derivative vanishes to second order at the seam, which is
# what makes it C^3 there.
smoother_deriv(sm, c(0.4, 0.49, 0.5, 0.51), order = 2)
#> [1] 0.4860000 0.0058806 0.0000000 0.0000000
